## Question : Given a satellite aerial image as water_body.png and the corresponding output expected is given as water_body_Mask.jpg. 
## Your task is to segment the water body from the image and compare your predicted image with the actual image.
## Apply necessary image preprocessing techniques to obtain the expected output. 
## What are the performance metrics you will consider in comparing the two images and give the score of the metrics and your inference.
## Overlay the predicted image on the actual image.
