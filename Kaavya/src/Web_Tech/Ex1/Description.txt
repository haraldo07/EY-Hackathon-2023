First of all, I have done a resume since I couldn't differentiate between
CV and resume efficiently. I personally picked this resume design because 
it looks easy to identify which tags are used. The colour looks modern and 
elegent but I modified it to my preferences. The content looks simple and 
strong which is the most important criteria for a resume. One more important 
reason to choose this design is because, even if you add anything like an 
iframe or image, the design doesn't look awkward at all.
