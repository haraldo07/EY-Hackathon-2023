Earlier this month , a China Construction Bank branch manager was jailed for life in a separate case. China 's banks used to act as cash offices for state enterprises and did not require checks on credit worthiness.

      " Bank of China is one of two frontrunners in the race to list overseas. They shared a $ 45bn state bailout in 2003 , to help clean up their balance sheets in preparation for a foreign stock market debut. However , a report in the China-published Economic Observer said on Monday that the two banks may have scrapped plans to list in New York because of the cost of meeting regulatory requirements imposed since the Enron scandal. Bank of China is the country 's biggest foreign exchange dealer , while China Construction Bank is the largest deposit holder. China 's banking sector is burdened with at least $ 190bn of bad debt according to official data , though most observers believe the true figure is far higher. Earlier this month , a China Construction Bank branch manager was jailed for life in a separate case. China 's banks used to act as cash offices for state enterprises and did not require checks on credit worthiness.

      " The pair both worked at Bank of China in the northern city of Harbin , the South China Morning Post reported. The latest scandal at Bank of China will do nothing to reassure foreign investors that China's big four banks are ready for international listings. Government policy sees the bank listings as vital economic reforms. Bank of China is one of two frontrunners in the race to list overseas. They shared a $ 45bn state bailout in 2003 , to help clean up their balance sheets in preparation for a foreign stock market debut. However , a report in the China-published Economic Observer said on Monday that the two banks may have scrapped plans to list in New York because of the cost of meeting regulatory requirements imposed since the Enron scandal. Bank of China is the country 's biggest foreign exchange dealer , while China Construction Bank is the largest deposit holder. China 's banking sector is burdened with at least $ 190bn of bad debt according to official data , though most observers believe the true figure is far higher. Attempts to strengthen internal controls and tighten lending policies have uncovered a succession of scandals involving embezzlement by bank officials and loans-for-favours. Earlier this month , a China Construction Bank branch manager was jailed for life in a separate case. China 's banks used to act as cash offices for state enterprises and did not require checks on credit worthiness. The introduction of market reforms has been accompanied by attempts to modernize the banking sector , but links between banks and local government remain strong. Last year , China's premier , Wen Jiabao , targeted bank lending practices in a series of speeches , and regulators ordered all big loans to be scrutinized , in an attempt to cool down irresponsible lending. China 's leaders see reforming the top four banks as vital to distribute capital to profitable companies and protect the health of China 's economic boom. First , inefficient state enterprises continue to receive protection from bankruptcy because they employ large numbers of people. Another high-profile financial firm , China Life , is facing shareholder lawsuits and a probe by the US Securities and Exchange Commission following its 2004 New York listing over its failure to disclose accounting irregularities at its parent company. \n"
